## How to contribute?

### Prerequisites

- Node, NPM
- Git (On windows: Git Bash)

### How to do it

Since I'm using a customized build system, I should tell you how to use it.

``` bash
# Setup gradle workspace and configure for IDE
npm run setup

# Run Minecraft Client
npm run client

# Run Minecraft Server
npm run server

# Build project
npm run build
```

The version must be changed in the "package.json" file.
